# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Analyze customer churn in a telecom company using data analysis techniques in Python.

## 🔍 Project Description
This project aims to understand the reasons behind customer churn in a telecom company by analyzing customer data and identifying key factors that influence customer retention or departure. The analysis provides insights into demographics, usage behavior, and contract details.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Project Contents
- `telecom_churn.csv`: The dataset used for analysis  
- `telecom_churn.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis workflow and visualizations

## 📈 Analysis Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean the data and handle missing values
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions and relationships
4. Visualize data to identify patterns and trends
5. Analyze results and interpret key drivers of churn

## 🧠 Key Findings
- Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn  
- Customers not using additional services have higher churn rates  
- Higher monthly charges are linked to increased churn

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
To run the analysis on your local machine:

1. Download the two files:
   - `telecom_churn.csv`
